# Introduction

In my last blog post I concluded that AI is not a threat to the jobs of Software Engineers (SWE). As a SWE this may seem biased, so I have decided to delve more deeply into this topic to discuss where AI is at the moment and why (_I believe_) we won't be replaced anytime soon. During this article I will touch on the concept of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), what this means, how close we are to it and it's relevance to the future of Software Development. I'll also talking about the hype around AI and why, all too often, we're seeing these inflated capabilites and pipe dreams rather than candor and reality.

# What is Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)?

The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been around since the 60s [[Rockwell, A. 2017]](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/history-artificial-intelligence/) so the concept of measuring the intelligence of AI is nothing new. One of the first tests to measure computer intelligence was from Alan Turing who proposed the 'Turing Test'. An AI would pass if it's responses to questions were indistinct from that of a human, regardless of their correctness. It feels like we are here with the most advanced Large Language Models (LLM) such as GPT-4o, but this isn't the point. Many consider the Turing test to be insufficient in measuring intelligence as it doesn't account for any concept of a "mind" or "conciousness". This test only measures one aspect of intelligence that a narrow AI** designed for natural language conversation, such as GPT-4o, is inherently good at.

A huge milestone, that many speculate on, is Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). AGI is the crown-jewel of AI research, but a hot topic for many in this community due to it's ethical concerns. **AGI is the concept of an AI that matches or even exceeds human intelligence and possesses 'human' features** such as:
* Adapting to problems it was not prepared for.
* Succeeding in a variety of different contexts and environments.
* Generalising knowledge gained to transfer between problems or contexts. 

These are just a small subset of the capabilities we, as humans, possess that enabled our species to succeed. The most advanced Artificial Intelligence models do not thrive in problems they were not specifically trained on.  


**Narrow AI: A system that carries out specific "intelligent" behaviours in specific contexts [[Kurzweil, R. 2005]]()

# Will we see AGI?

<!--
- Elon Musk's claims
- Academics claims (find X rant)
- If we see AGI then we may see a move towards AI replacing devs
- Very contested topic, so I won't draw too many conclusions. Many academic papers have defined what is required to consider this.
- There are challenges that AI cannot complete
- Surely the if AI can only complete a subset of challenges a human can complete than it cannot be considered generally intelligent
- The ability to adapt and infer with limited information and in different environments is what makes humans excel and where AI has shortfalls
- Compute and energy

As mentioned, AGI is a hot topic rife with hype and speculation from those seeking to profit and academics diligently exploring its possibilities and implications.
Elon Musk claims that we will see AGI next year and some form of Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) by 2029. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">AI will probably be smarter than any single human next year. By 2029, AI is probably smarter than all humans combined. <a href="https://t.co/RO3g2OCk9x">https://t.co/RO3g2OCk9x</a></p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1767738797276451090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


I think these are wildly optimistic claims given the current state of artificial intelligence research and development;
despite significant progress, many technical and ethical hurdles remain, and the substitution of Software Developers by AI will only become feasible come AGI, which I think we're much further from than some predict.




# The Hype

<!--
  - The market incentives to make AI profitiable and desire to hype as much as possible. Sometimes further than it's capabilities.
  - Faked demos with best case examples, AI in the best environments with the most favorable examples/test data
  - Devin AI
  - Gemini fakes
  - Rabbit R1
  - NVidia most valuable company in world

# Devs Are Expensive, So Are Mistakes...

<!--
- Candid about how good AI actually is
- Emotional aspect
- Middle management held accountable if they're the ones instructing AI
- Ethical issues with AGI
  -->

# Back To Reality

<!--
- I honestly think AI is great, I think it will be the biggest disruptor since the internet and has huge potential
- Save t
