# Introduction

In my last blog post I concluded that AI is not a threat to the jobs of Software Engineers (SWE). As a SWE this may seem biased, so I have decided to delve more deeply into this topic to discuss where AI is at the moment and why (_I believe_) we won't be replaced anytime soon. During this article I will touch on the concept of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), what this means, how close we are to it and it's relevance to the future of Software Development. I'll also talking about the hype around AI and why, all too often, we're seeing these inflated capabilites and pipe dreams rather than candor and reality.

# What is Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)?

The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been around since the 60s [[A. Rockwell, 2017]](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/history-artificial-intelligence/) so the concept of measuring the intelligence of this AI is nothing new. One of the first tests to measure computer intelligence was from Alan Turing who proposed the 'Turing Test'. An AI would pass if it's responses to questions were indistinct from that of a human, regardless of their correctness.

# AI in 2024 vs AGI vs Human Intelligence

# Will we see AGI?

<!--
- Elon Musk's claims
- Academics claims (find X rant)
- If we see AGI then we may see a move towards AI replacing devs
- Very contested topic, so I won't draw too many conclusions. Many academic papers have defined what is required to consider this.
- There are challenges that AI cannot complete
- Surely the if AI can only complete a subset of challenges a human can complete than it cannot be considered generally intelligent
- The ability to adapt and infer with limited information and in different environments is what makes humans excel and where AI has shortfalls

# The Hype

<!--
  - The market incentives to make AI profitiable and desire to hype as much as possible. Sometimes further than it's capabilities.
  - Faked demos with best case examples, AI in the best environments with the most favorable examples/test data
  - Devin AI
  - Gemini fakes
  - NVidia most valuable company in world

# Devs Are Expensive, So Are Mistakes...

<!--
- Candid about how good AI actually is
- Emotional aspect
- Middle management held accountable if they're the ones instructing AI
- Ethical issues with AGI
  -->

# Back To Reality

<!--
- I honestly think AI is great, I think it will be the biggest disruptor since the internet and has huge potential
- Save t
