## GitHub CoPilot Investigation - Crash Landing or Smooth Soaring?
### Introduction
In my last blog I spoke about not knowing the capability of GitHub Co-Pilot. I decided to change by signing up for the 30 day free trial and began my invesitgation. I set out to determine the effectiveness, accuracy and security of GitHub Co-Pilot as an assistant/tool for programming. The end goal being a justification 

For context, GitHub Co-Pilot is an AI powerered assistant specifically trained to assist with programming. It can be installed as an extension in your programming environment (IDE) of choice to give code completions, code explainations or 
offer code fixes. This invesitgation primarly used the Visual Studio Code IDE for reasons explained later.

### Prior Understanding
### First Impressions
### Good Examples
Screenshots
Really good for pipeline creation, bicep, IaC etc
### Bad Examples
Screenshots
### Security Concerns
Research and reference privacy policies 
### Conclusions

As mentioned earlier, the investigation was conducted in Visual Studio Code, primarly. However, I did conduct some testing on the same code in Visual Studio Professional 2022 in order to perform some comparisons.

Better in VS Code compared to Visual Studio and explain why
Pitch to my company why we should/shouldn't use it

In my eyes I do not see AI as a threat to the jobs of Software Engineers. It's purely a tool, when used correctly, can increase the efficiency of certain day-to-day tasks. There are many stages of the Software Development lifecycle which simply cannot be completed by an AI (at the moment) and the main ones are centered determining what the client/product owner want and subsequently prioritising and breaking down these requirements. You could say that AI is a headless chicken that regains it's head upon direction and context from the prompter.

It needs direction and of course understand what the client needs instead of wants. - Something like that
Inline makes it so much easier
Ctrl+I
/fix 
/explain good for getting to grips with new codebases
